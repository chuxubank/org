- *Led the refactor of core smart-lock setup flows using Jetpack Compose*, designing reusable, state-driven UI architecture;
  implemented and integrated custom ExoPlayer components with Compose, significantly simplifying device binding and configuration workflows,
  and presented the solution to global teams at an All-Hands Meeting.
- *Redesigned BI and analytics systems to support Compose architecture*, building generic SideEffect-based utilities for low-intrusion data collection;
  enabled asynchronous reporting of metrics such as page views via WorkManager.
- *Migrated the device QR scanning module from Camera2 to CameraX*, resolving autofocus and compatibility issues across devices;
  implemented region-restricted QR scanning with Compose to improve scanning accuracy and user experience.
- *Drove dependency injection and testing framework upgrades*:
  led the migration from Dagger to Hilt to simplify dependency management;
  upgraded testing from JUnit4 to JUnit5 with parallel execution, significantly reducing CI test duration.
- *Led multi-flavor architecture governance*:
  consolidated multiple product flavors into a unified codebase through modularization, componentization, and custom build logic;
  enabled flavor-specific dependencies and configurations, reducing maintenance complexity and improving build consistency.
- *Optimized application startup and initialization architecture*:
  split startup tasks using App Startup and managed initialization dependencies via Hilt Initializers;
  resolved legacy initialization coupling issues and documented startup flows and dependency graphs using PlantUML.
- *Introduced AI-assisted development practices into daily engineering work*:
  leveraged AI tools such as CLI Agents and Cursor, and explored MCP / ACP–based workflows in real projects,
  supporting code generation, refactoring, debugging, testing, review, and overall engineering productivity.
- *Refactored and optimized Concourse CI pipelines*:
  eliminated redundant configurations through parameterization and templating, fine-tuned Gradle parameters,
  and introduced task caching, achieving approximately 2× build performance improvement despite reduced build resources.

- *Developed Android clients for RFID-based library inventory systems* using a C/S architecture;
  communicated with RFID scanners via Bluetooth and implemented client-side classification and call-number sorting algorithms
  to improve inventory accuracy and efficiency.
  Optimized backend deployment workflows using Docker to accelerate device delivery.
- *Maintained and refactored dual-door RFID self-service borrowing/return terminals*,
  improving code structure and readability while fixing multiple stability issues;
  added remote configuration management and soft/hard reboot capabilities via a central control system.
- *Developed a C++ authorization and licensing library* using Crypto++ and built with CMake,
  supporting authorization and validation across multiple terminal devices.
- *Built face registration terminal applications in Kotlin*:
  leveraged Google ML Kit and CameraX to perform face detection and angle validation;
  automatically captured and cropped facial images when conditions were met, binding them with card IDs obtained via HID devices,
  enabling dual authentication (card + face) for access control systems.
- *Developed an offline-capable e-book reading application* using Jetpack components and modern Android stacks,
  including Hilt, Retrofit2, Moshi, Coil, Coroutines, and Flow;
  supported online/offline usage and enabled administrators to batch-import book metadata and content via XLSX and ZIP files
  (PDF and EPUB supported).
- *Developed self-service library terminals using Jetpack Compose*,
  enabling users to borrow and return books by scanning WeChat reader QR codes;
  refactored Android serial communication libraries with Kotlin coroutines,
  supporting USB serial and RS-232 / RS-485 communication.

- Developed NFC utility applications for mobile devices,
  using Retrofit for network communication, Realm for local data persistence,
  and integrating with Android NFC modules to perform tag read/write operations.
- Implemented login session persistence using PersistentCookieJar;
  identified inconsistencies between the library’s cookie validation logic and backend expectations,
  and resolved the issue via Java method overriding to ensure stable authentication.
