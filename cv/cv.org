- *Responsible for maintenance and evolution of the Yale Home Android apps (domestic and international)*:
  Production-grade applications serving high MAU and cross-region users;
  supporting IoT devices such as smart locks and window openers, including device onboarding, configuration, BLE control, remote control, and OTA upgrades;
  participated in cross-team technical discussions and design reviews to ensure stability and scalability in complex device environments.
- *Driving migration of core modules and engineering infrastructure to modern tech stacks*:
  Led multiple key module and infrastructure upgrades while ensuring online stability;
  migrated the device QR scanning module from =Camera2= to =CameraX=, resolving focus and compatibility issues across devices, enabling region-based scanning, and significantly improving recognition success rate and user experience;
  promoted DI and testing stack upgrades, completing migrations from =Dagger= to =Hilt= and =JUnit4= to =JUnit5=;
  introduced parallel test execution, substantially reducing CI test duration and long-term maintenance cost.
- *Introducing AI-assisted development practices and fostering technical knowledge sharing*:
  Proficient in AI-assisted development tools (CLI Agent, Cursor);
  applied MCP / ACP protocols in real projects for code generation, refactoring, debugging, testing, and review, improving overall engineering efficiency;
  delivered multiple internal technical sharing sessions, attended developer conferences such as Google I/O, and completed MongoDB-related technical training to continuously track platform and infrastructure evolution.
- *Responsible for Concourse CI refactoring and performance optimization*:
  Refactored CI pipelines through parameterization, templating, and build tuning;
  implemented reusable submodule packaging and release capabilities based on Concourse Tasks;
  introduced Task-level caching, achieving approximately 2× build performance improvement under reduced build resources;
  participated in the full release lifecycle from build and testing to store submission, making release decisions based on metrics such as crash rate.
