:END:
- *Maintained and evolved Yale Home (a core smart home App with global users) Android client*:
  A production-grade application serving high MAU and cross-regional users,
  supporting smart lock binding, configuration, Bluetooth control, and remote management.
  Long-term involvement in core feature development, architectural evolution, and stability assurance.
- *Led Jetpack Compose refactoring in core Yale Home user journeys*:
  Covered high-frequency scenarios such as smart lock onboarding, configuration, and settings;
  designed reusable, state-driven UI architecture.
  Built and encapsulated custom ExoPlayer components deeply integrated with Compose,
  enabling gradual UI stack migration while maintaining production stability.
  Presented technical and product outcomes at global All-Hands meetings.
- *Redesigned BI and analytics system to adapt to Compose architecture*:
  Built generic SideEffect utilities for Compose to enable lightweight data collection (e.g. page PV),
  and used WorkManager for asynchronous reporting to reduce business logic intrusion.
- *Migrated device QR scanning module from Camera2 to CameraX*:
  Resolved focus and compatibility issues across diverse devices,
  and implemented region-limited QR scanning combined with Compose UI,
  significantly improving scan success rate and user experience.
- *Drove dependency injection and testing framework upgrades*:
  Led migration from Dagger to Hilt, simplifying dependency graphs while maintaining MVVM and Clean Architecture.
  Upgraded test framework from JUnit4 to JUnit5 and enabled parallel test execution,
  significantly reducing CI test execution time.
- *Led multi-flavor build architecture governance*:
  Consolidated multiple brand flavors into a unified codebase via modularization and custom build logic,
  enabling flavor-specific dependency injection and build configuration.
  Reduced APK size and maintenance complexity while improving build consistency.
- *Optimized application startup and initialization dependencies*:
  Leveraged App Startup to split initialization tasks and introduced Hilt into Initializers
  for unified dependency management, improving cold start performance.
  Resolved historical initialization coupling issues and documented startup flows and dependency graphs
  using PlantUML within the codebase.
- *Introduced AI-assisted development practices into engineering workflows*:
  Proficient with AI development tools (CLI Agents, Cursor),
  and applied MCP / ACP protocols in real projects for code generation, refactoring,
  debugging, testing, review, and overall productivity improvement.
- *Led Concourse CI pipeline refactoring and performance optimization*:
  Rebuilt pipelines through parameterization, templating, and build tuning.
  Implemented reusable packaging and release capabilities via Concourse Tasks,
  introduced Task-level caching, and achieved ~2× build performance improvement under reduced resources.
  Participated in the full release lifecycle from build to store deployment,
  monitoring crash rates to guide release decisions.

:END:
- *Developed a Java-based Android client for a library inventory system*:
  Adopted a C/S architecture and communicated with RFID scanners via Bluetooth
  to enable rapid inventory checking.
  Implemented call-number sorting algorithms on the client side to improve verification efficiency.
  Optimized server deployment using Docker, accelerating on-site delivery.
- *Maintained and refactored a dual-door RFID self-service borrowing/returning cabinet system*:
  Improved code structure and readability while preserving existing functionality,
  and fixed multiple stability issues.
  Added remote configuration and soft/hard reboot capabilities via a central control system,
  significantly improving device operations efficiency.
- *Developed an authorization control library in C++ (Crypto++)*:
  Built cross-platform solutions using CMake to support authorization and validation
  across multiple terminal devices.
- *Independently designed and implemented multiple terminal and business-oriented Android applications*:
  Covered scenarios such as face registration terminals, e-book readers,
  and self-service borrowing/returning terminals,
  selecting and delivering appropriate technical stacks based on hardware constraints and business requirements.
- *Led architecture design and core feature implementation for face registration terminals*:
  Used Kotlin, CameraX, and Google ML Kit to implement face detection and pose validation.
  Automatically captured and cropped face images when conditions were met,
  and bound them with card IDs from HID devices,
  enabling dual authentication modes (card / face) for access control systems.
- *Implemented core features and architecture for an e-book reader application*:
  Based on modern Android stack (Jetpack components, Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Room),
  supporting online/offline reading, cache management, and asynchronous data handling.
  Implemented waterfall-style book lists and enabled admin-side batch import
  of book content via XLSX / ZIP packages.
- *Applied Jetpack Compose and hardware communication abstraction in self-service terminals*:
  Built terminal UIs using Jetpack Compose,
  and wrapped Android serial communication libraries with Kotlin coroutines,
  supporting USB serial as well as RS-232 / RS-485 communication.
