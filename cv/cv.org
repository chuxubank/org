- *Responsible for maintenance and evolution of the Yale Home Android apps (domestic and international)*:
  Production-grade applications serving high MAU and cross-region users;
  supporting IoT devices such as smart locks and window openers, including device onboarding, configuration, BLE control, remote control, and OTA upgrades;
  participated in cross-team technical discussions and design reviews to ensure stability and scalability in complex device environments.
- *Driving migration of core modules and engineering infrastructure to modern tech stacks*:
  Led multiple key module and infrastructure upgrades while ensuring online stability;
  migrated the device QR scanning module from Camera2 to CameraX, resolving focus and compatibility issues across devices, enabling region-based scanning, and significantly improving recognition success rate and user experience;
  promoted DI and testing stack upgrades, completing migrations from Dagger to Hilt and JUnit4 to JUnit5;
  introduced parallel test execution, substantially reducing CI test duration and long-term maintenance cost.
- *Introducing AI-assisted development practices and fostering technical knowledge sharing*:
  Proficient in AI-assisted development tools (CLI Agent, Cursor);
  applied MCP / ACP protocols in real projects for code generation, refactoring, debugging, testing, and review, improving overall engineering efficiency;
  delivered multiple internal technical sharing sessions, attended developer conferences such as Google I/O, and completed MongoDB-related technical training to continuously track platform and infrastructure evolution.
- *Responsible for Concourse CI refactoring and performance optimization*:
  Refactored CI pipelines through parameterization, templating, and build tuning;
  implemented reusable submodule packaging and release capabilities based on Concourse Tasks;
  introduced Task-level caching, achieving approximately 2× build performance improvement under reduced build resources;
  participated in the full release lifecycle from build and testing to store submission, making release decisions based on metrics such as crash rate.

- *Developed a Java-based Android client for a library inventory system* using a C/S architecture;
  communicated with RFID scanners via Bluetooth to enable fast inventory scanning;
  implemented call-number sorting algorithms on the client side to improve inventory and verification efficiency;
  optimized server deployment using Docker, accelerating device delivery.
- *Maintained and refactored a dual-door RFID self-service borrowing/returning cabinet system*:
  improved code structure and readability while preserving existing functionality, and fixed multiple stability issues;
  added remote configuration modification and soft/hard reboot capabilities via a central control system, significantly improving operational efficiency.
- *Developed a licensing and authorization control library in C++ (Crypto++)*,
  built cross-platform using CMake to support authorization and validation across multiple terminal devices.
- *Independently designed and implemented multiple terminal and business-oriented Android applications*:
  covering face registration terminals, e-book reading applications, and self-service library terminals;
  selected appropriate technology stacks and delivered solutions based on hardware constraints and business requirements.
- *Led the architecture design and core implementation of a face registration terminal*:
  implemented face detection and angle validation using Kotlin, CameraX, and Google ML Kit;
  automatically captured and cropped face regions when conditions were met, binding them with card IDs obtained from HID devices;
  enabled dual authentication modes (“card / face”) for access control systems.
- *Responsible for core feature development and architecture implementation of an e-book reader application*:
  built on Jetpack architecture components and modern Android stacks (Hilt, Coroutines, Flow, Room, etc.);
  implemented online/offline reading, cache management, and asynchronous data handling;
  supported waterfall-style book lists and provided admin-side bulk import of book content via XLSX / ZIP.
- *Led Jetpack Compose adoption and hardware communication abstraction for self-service terminals*:
  built terminal UIs using Jetpack Compose;
  wrapped Android serial communication libraries with Kotlin coroutines;
  supported USB serial as well as RS-232 / RS-485 communication.
